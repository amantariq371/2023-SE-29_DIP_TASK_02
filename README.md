Color Channel Analysis and Object Detection (Task 02)

This Python program performs color channel analysis, grayscale and binary conversion, and connected component labeling on a user-uploaded image. It separates the image into Red, Green, and Blue channels and displays each component individually. The program also converts the image to grayscale and binary formats using thresholding. Finally, it detects and counts connected components (objects) in the binary image and visualizes each object in a random color-labeled image. This allows users to analyze individual color contributions, study image structure, and identify distinct objects in the scene.

Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib
